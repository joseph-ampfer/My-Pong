# My-Pong
Second thing I ever coded, I had to make one more game on 11/04/2023.

I felt inspired while working on the first CS50 project and made this as well!

### Like classic Pong, but with my twist

It is a Scratch game, and .sb3 file.

Also available here: https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/918142265

### Takeaways
I learned about functions, conditionals, loops, and variables, and how to use them to build a fun game!
